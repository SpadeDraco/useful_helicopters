# useful_helicopters
A Cataclysm DDA mod that rebalances helicopters to make them more practical. Has recently undergone a complete overhaul to make it compatible with 0.F and address issues with the initial (extremely hacky) release. The goal of this mod is to make helicopters actually factor into gameplay in an authentic and fun way. This is not a "realism" mod, but it is also not designed to (intentionally) enable giant flying bases. Currently supports 0.F stable and 0.G Experimental.

Stable Version does the following things:

-Reduces fuel cost of turbine engines. This allows most default helicopters to operate for 4-6 hours on a full tank of gas. Instead of the pathetic 20 minutes they do in vanilla. If 4-6 hours doesn't sound like alot consider that most default Helos can easily cruise at 200 mph and bypass all obstacles. Trust me it isn't that limiting.

-Adds the Airframe and Powerplant Mechanic trait to all pilot professions. This allows all pilots to repair and modify helicopters so long as skill level permits.

-Adds a bionic that gives both the "Helicopter Pilot" and "A&P Mechanic" proficiencies. Bionic is called "Pilot Package CBM" and has an average chance to show up most places you can find bionics.

-Makes Rotors repairable and removable. Yes this means you can put them on your Secuirty Van. They have weight limits though so they probably won't be able to lift it without a turbine engine.

-Makes the "Helicopter Pilot" and "Airframe and Powerplant Mechanic" proficiencies learnable via crafting. (Unfinished. No recipes teach them yet.)

Limitations:
Messing with rotors before you acquire the "A&P Mechanic" trait will still result in a permanent loss of airworthiness. After the proficiency is aqcuired you can slap rotors on literally anything and so long as the engine is strong enough it'll fly.
You still need the pilot trait (via profession or the included CBM) to fly
These are hardcode limitations. I can't do anything about them. Sorry.


Experimental Version:

In 0.G Experimental many of the issues this mod was created to address have been (at least partially) solved. Currently the experimental version of this mod:

-Adds "Airframe and Powerplant Mechanic" as a selectable 2-point hobby at character creation.

and

-Makes rotors removable and repairable by the player.

Future versions will make tweaks to Turbine fuel consumption, which are much better by default in 0.G Experimental but still not quite right, and re-add the "Pilot Package" CBM once the Exodii faction that now sources CBMs is slightly more fleshed out.
